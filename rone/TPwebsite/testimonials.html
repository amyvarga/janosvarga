					Roné has always gone above and beyond the call of duty as my phyisotherapist. She always found a way to make things work. I could not have asked for more from her in the 10 years that she worked with me, and I owe a large portion of my success to her skills in finding ways to keep me injury-free, or back on track as quickly as possible following an injury.

					I have known Roné since early 2000 and she has always been the physio I use when I am injured as I know she has come across almost every injury in the book and she has worked with some of the best athletes in the world ... and the best only use the best!
					<br><br>
					My last injury was a very complicated muscle imbalance with which I was struggling to simply walk and training was almost impossible. Roné gave me some fantastic treatment, changed my strength and conditioning program, and at the age of 34 I am still able to win races thanks to her.

					Having retired from professional cycling in 2004, but continuing to remain competitive and active I spent most of 2010/11 racing in the UK adventure race scene with great success until, following a successful 2nd place at the Devon Coast2Coast  145 mile race,  an old back injury (prolapsed disc) caught up with me.
					<br><br>
					After 18 frustrating months I was recommended to see Roné who worked tirelessly to get me back to a place where I was pain free and addressing some of my functional limitations through a very rigorous hands-on approach combined with continual and progressive gym programs. I have worked with numerous physiotherapists over the years but I have never come across someone who is as competent and professional in their approach. I would highly recommend Roné to anyone without any hesitation.

					I have worked closely with Roné for a number of years. She was always just as committed to success as the athletes she worked with. I will be forever grateful that she helped me to become World Champion in 2011. She also helped me to overcome major surgery months before the London Olympics, at which I finished a respectable 4th. None of which would have been possible without her significant input.
