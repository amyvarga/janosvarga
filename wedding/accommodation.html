They cater for single room, double room, 2 and 3 bedroom apartments.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">I've done quite a bit of searching around for good websites for accommodation in Cape Town and am struggling to find ones that bring back good results with all the info you need displayed. The best site that I've come across is <a class="link" href="http://www.capestay.co.za/cape-town-self-catering.asp" target="_blank">Cape Stay</a>.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><td class="detail-cell"><a class="link" href="http://www.capestay.co.za/cape-town-self-catering.asp" target="_blank">Cape Stay</a> search site offers the ability to search particular suburbs in CT. Generally, accommodation will be cheaper in the southern and northern suburbs compared with atlantic seaboard and city bowl. It does then mean a drive into the city for some things (roughly 20-30 minutes for southern suburbs and 30-40 minutes for northern suburbs), but many of the  attractions and activities are out of the city so I don't particularly feel like one needs to stay there. Stellenbosch and Somerset West are 2 other options - Stellies certainly is very beautiful. But note that they are 50km out of CT and it's quite dangerous to drive the N2 at night. No matter where you stay you will still need a car. <b>I would recommend looking for a spot in southern suburbs if your budget is limited</b> since it's fairly central to everything. See further details below.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">Wherever you stay in Cape Town it is advised to keep security features in mind, especially if you're hiring out a house. Things like security gates, electric fencing and alarms provide that extra level of security and peace of mind. It really does depend on the area and the particular accommodation - a secure apartment block vs a house for example. If you're unsure or would like some help deciding then just ask us.</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="detail-cell">On the <a href="itinerary.html" class="link">Itinerary</a> page you'll see we keen to do 3 nights in Kruger at the end of our trip. If you're keen to join then let us know, it would be great to have you along! We will soon finalise and flesh out the details for the Kruger trip because we will need to get our accommodation booked asap as they get booked very far in advance. You can find all information you need for Kruger on the <a href="https://www.sanparks.org/parks/kruger/" target="_blank" class="link">SAN Parks</a> website - camps, gates, day entry, and accommodation and game drive bookings.</td></tr> 
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">If you want to do Kruger at a different time to us, or want to get your bookings done despite what we end up doing, then please just go ahead and get yourselves sorted. Kruger is a very big park so it's important to note what gate you plan to enter in and out from, and to take into account the distances between camps and gates and the speed limit. The <a href="https://www.sanparks.org/parks/kruger/get_there/default.php" target="_blank" class="link">How To Get There</a> page on the website has some good info on the approximate travel times between gates and camps. Remember the point is not to speed from one to the other but rather to amble along very slowly while on the lookout for game! So rather keep distances short and allocate lots of time to get around.</td></tr>	
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">Because it is a lot of stop start and very slow driving I would recommend getting an automatic rental car!</td></tr>
