Please don't let the below info scare you - it really isn't so bad ... both our mums are living very happily in South Africa.</td></tr>	
			 <tr><td class="detail-cell">The reality is that there is a lot of poverty in South Africa, and quite a contrast between upper and lower class living. So theft is a common crime, but the unfortunate part is that they are willing to use violence to get what they want. The best advice is to not flaunt flashy things like smart phones, cameras, chunky gold jewellery and big diamond rings. Don't put your wallet in your back pocket and don't keep it stuffed fill of notes - just keep a few notes and coins in your wallet and your main stash tucked away safely somewhere else. Keep a hand on your bag and it zipped closed. Basically, the more local you look the less likely you'll be a target for theft! Try to think if you were living in poverty what kind of situation or behaviour would tempt you to consider stealing something?</td></tr>

			 <ol>
			 <li>Drive with your car doors locked</li>
			 <li>Don't put your handbag on the passenger seat or back seat</li>
			 <li>Be aware of what is happening around you when walking the streets at night or when stopping at traffic lights at night, and just generally be vigilant of your surroundings.</li>
			 <li>Don't flaunt flashy things like smart phones, cameras, chunky gold jewellery and big diamond rings</li>
			 <li>Don't keep wads of cash in your wallet</li>

			<tr><td class="detail-cell">The one issue Roné and I had when going back to SA was to get a local SIM - the mobile stores (not at the airport) insisted on us having proof of local address in order to get a SIM, even for a pay-as-you-go SIM. I'm not sure if this is still the case, but to avoid any issues we would recommend you get a SIM at the airport. All the major networks have a shop there. You can also pre-order a SIM online <a href="http://www.b4igo.travel/prepaid-starter-packs/" target="_blank" class="link">here</a>, and then pick it up at the airport.</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="detail-cell" colspan=2><p class="headline">TAXI</p></td></tr>
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">We definitely recommend you rent a car for getting around, since public transport is limited and not always safe, especially at night or during less busy hours. See the information on car rental on the <a href="travel.html" class="link">Travel</a> page. If you do need transport to or from something then you can use the private taxis and they are safe. Uber Taxi operates in Cape Town and you can use the phone app to book a taxi on demand.</td></tr>
