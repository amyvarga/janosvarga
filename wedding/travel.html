			<tr><td class="detail-cell">You can fly direct to Cape Town with British Airways. Their prices are not always the cheapest, but the bonus of having a single 12 hour flight can outweigh the price difference, depending on your priorities and budget. For the past few years BA has held an online 'world sale' in January, which most often includes CT as a destination. Of course I can't guarantee that there will be a sale again in January 2017 so it's up to you if you would like to wait and see.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">South African Airways, Qatar Airways and KLM are other airlines that fly to CT and will mostly be cheaper than BA, but the journey will contain a stopover (Joburg, Doha and Amsterdam respectively). However if you book early enough you might be able to get a journey that has a short stopover and hence the total travel time can be as little as 15 hours. Emirates is also an option but since the flight goes via Dubai, which is way off route, the total journey time ends up being quite long and not ideal.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">&nbsp;</td></tr>
			
			<tr><td class="detail-cell standout">From NZ</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">You have 3 airlines to chose from: South African Airways, Qantas or Air New Zealand. Unfortunately all of them go via Oz and Joburg - I couldn't find any flights that did not stopover in Joburg ... but that's not to say they don't exist, I just don't know of them myself. Depending on the airline the Oz stopover is either Sydney or Perth, but ultimately your travel time is pretty much the same for both. If you get a good connection flight the best total journey time is roughly 24 hours.</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">&nbsp;</td></tr>
			
			<tr><td class="detail-cell standout">Within South Africa</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">South Africa has 3 low cost airlines - <a class="link" href="http://www.kalula.com" target="_blank">Kalula</a>, <a class="link" href="http://www.1time.co.za" target="_blank">1 Time</a> and <a class="link" href="https://www.flymango.com" target="_blank">Mango</a>. They are all decent airlines. Alternatively you can of course fly <a class="link" href="http://www.flysaa.com" target="_blank">SAA</a> but they are generally more expensive.</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="detail-cell" colspan=2><p class="headline">CAR RENTAL</p></td></tr>
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">You will need a car while in SA, and most probably for the entire span of your stay here. Public transport is very limited and not always safe, especially at night or during less busy hours.</td></tr>
				
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">You can save money on the car rental by not paying for insurance cover through the car rental company but instead getting excess insurance through your travel insurance or using an independent company e.g. http://www.insurance4carhire.com/. This way is often A LOT cheaper than through the car rental company, especially when renting for more than just a few days.</td></tr>

			<tr><td class="detail-cell"><a class="link" href="http://www.rentalcars.com" target="_blank">rentalcars.com</a> is a really good car rental website that searches all the main car rental companies for a specific location, and in my experience, always brings back the best rate you can get. Note that most of the time the car rental agreement includes CDW but with a high excess, hence the bit above about getting excess insurance. You can of course google something like "car rental cape town" and get quotes from some of the other companies. I had a look around and even the car rental companies like <a class="link" href="http://www.rentacheapie.co.za"  target="_blank">rentacheapie.co.za</a> didn't come back with a quote that beat what I got from rentalcars.com, but definitely worth having a look around!</td></tr>
