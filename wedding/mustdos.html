If you do chose to do a different route just make sure you have clear directions and have chosen something that suits your ability level. Table Mountain is a mountain, so don't underestimate it. Take plenty of water and warm clothing, even if it's a sunny clear day. The <a class="link" href="http://www.tablemountain.net/" target="_blank">cable car</a> is the other way up, and your quads will definitely be happier. You can hike up, cable car down, or hike down, or cable car up and down ... just choose the combo that suits you best. Be aware that the cable car gets closed if its too windy. They will sound a siren to warn people on the top that the last cable car will be heading down soon. So keep this in mind if you're walking up ... too windy and you'll be walking down too! (that's happened to me more times than I care to remember :).

They are right on the beach and swimming in the water with you. It's a really beautiful small beach nestled among boulders. The water is not too cold either (False bay) and sheltered. Because it's a small beach it gets packed during peak periods or weekends, so it's best to go here during the week. There is a small charge to access the beach.

						</td>
						<td class="itinerary-cell2">No visit to South Africa is complete without a visit to a game park. You have the choice of either going private or to one of the national parks. The type of game in each park varies so make sure you check what they have first - some just have buck while others will have the Big 5 plus more. The biggest difference is of course price. The private ones tend to be posher and more expensive. The prices at the national parks are really reasonable and the accommodation, in my opinion, really good. You do also have the option of going luxury in the national parks as they offer private accommodation options too. Another difference is that often in the private parks you cannot drive around in your own vehicle - you have to pay for a game drive - whereas in the national parks you can cruise around in your own vehicle and/or go for a paid game drive. This <a class="link" href="https://www.sanparks.org/" target="_blank">website</a> lists all the South African National Parks and has details for each. Not all are game parks - the 2 that I do know are game parks is <a class="link" href="https://www.sanparks.org/parks/addo/" target="_blank">Addo</a> and <a class="link" href="https://www.sanparks.org/parks/kruger/" target="_blank">Kruger</a>. There's quite a few private game parks around Cape Town, I think the closest is about 2.5 hours drive from Cape Town. Again take note of the animals that they have, so you don't go there hoping to spot lion only to find they don't have lion! Here are some but there may be more: <a class="link" href="http://grgamelodge.co.za/" target="_blank">Garden Route Game Lodge</a>,  <a class="link" href="http://www.inverdoorn.com/" target="_blank">Inverdoorn</a>, <a class="link" href="http://www.botlierskop.co.za/" target="_blank">Botlierskop</a> and <a class="link" href="http://www.sanbona.com/" target="_blank">Sanbona</a>.

						<td class="itinerary-cell2">Cape Town has some really stunning beaches ... white sand, crystal blue water, fun waves. The only downside is that the water is SUPER chilly! On the Atlantic side that is, in False Bay the water temperature is much more do-able and it is possible to swim without a wetsuit. That said, it's all about the water currents and what they're doing - water temperature on the Atlantic side can range from 8 degrees C to 14 degrees, so if you hit the beach on a good day you might be able to have a swim, or at least a splash! <a class="link" href="http://www.capetown.travel/attractions/entry/Camps_Bay" target="_blank">Camps Bay</a> is probably the most popular beach, mainly because there are shops, restaurants and bars along the beach front. Of course that means it's also likely to be the most busy beach, especially during a holiday period like Easter. The <a class="link" href="http://www.capetown.travel/attractions/entry/Clifton" target="_blank">Cliftons</a> (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th) are really nice beaches and just round the corner from Camps Bay. <a class="link" href="http://www.capetown.travel/attractions/entry/llandudno_cape_town" target="_blank">Llandudno</a> is another lovely beach and probably my favourite since it can tend to be a little less busy. <a class="link" href="http://www.capetown.travel/attractions/entry/muizenberg" target="_blank">Muizenberg</a> is on the False Bay side and is a very popular beach for beginner surfers. See below under the 'Surf Lessons' activity :). Further along down the peninsula there is <a class="link" href="http://www.capetown.travel/attractions/entry/scarborough" target="_blank">Scarborough</a> beach which is absolutely gorgeous, but note it's more of a 'wild' beach and although you definitely can swim here there are no life guards and you must be careful. And of course there is <a class="link" href="http://www.capetown.travel/attractions/entry/Boulders_penguin_colony" target="_blank">Boulders Beach</a> (see above for this activity), which is a really beautiful beach with the added bonus of penquins! If you do join us to Knysna then there are some awesome beaches there too, my favourite being <a class="link" href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/Attraction_Review-g312664-d2481578-Reviews-Brenton_on_Sea-Knysna_Western_Cape.html" target="_blank">Brenton-On-Sea</a>.</td>

I found the tour of the prison and island really interesting and think it's definitely something worth doing if you have the time. The ferries leave from the V&A waterfront. You can buy tickets there or online <a class="link" href="http://www.robben-island.org.za/" target="_blank">here</a>. I would recommend buying your tickets ahead of time - not sure exactly how much ahead of time is needed but I'd say at least a couple of weeks to be safe.</td>

							<span class="main">Wine Tasting</span>
						</td>
						<td class="itinerary-cell2">The Cape is famous for its stunning wines and a visit here just wouldn't be complete without doing a day of wine tasting. There are literally hundreds of vineyards to choose from. I found <a class="link" href ="http://www.capetownmagazine.com/top-wine-tastings" target="_blank">this</a> review to be quite good as it details the different estates and what type of wine and tastings they offer, plus their prices. Generally you have to pay for a tasting - it used to be free but the students abused this so they started charging. However the price is very reasonable and ranges from as little as R15 to R50, depending on the vineyard. This price usually includes 3-5 wines to taste. Many estates offer tasting combos - wine & biltong or wine & cheese for example. And some have restaurants too. As mentioned in our itinerary, one of our favourites is <a class="link" href="http://www.waterfordestate.co.za/" target="_blank">Waterford</a> where you can do a wine & chocolate tasting which is quite special. I've also put a few others on the itinerary page that I would recommend. The vineyards spread out really far, so make sure you pick a few that are close-ish together. The Helderberg and Helshoogte are both stunningly beautiful valleys and it's definitely worth going to one or 2 vineyards in each area just so you get to drive through them. The town of Stellenbosch is also beautiful and has some very traditional Cape Dutch buildings and is worth driving through and perhaps stopping for a meal there.</td>

						<td class="itinerary-cell2"><a class="link" href="http://capepoint.co.za/" target="_blank">Cape Point</a> is where the Indian and Atlantic oceans meet. It's a dramatic place and awesome to stand at the tip of Africa (although Cape Point is not actually the most southern point of Africa - Cape Agulhus is). Cape Point in itself is a worthwhile destination, but the trip there and back makes it even more so. Heading there on the False Bay side passing through Fish Hoek, Kalk Bay and Simon's Town (where Boulders Beach is), and on the way back along the Atlantic side past Misty Cliffs, Scarborough, Noordhoek and along Chapsmans Peak (or vice versa). This is such a stunning drive and there are loads of spots along the way to stop and take pictures or picnic or just soak up the view. Cafe Olympia in Kalk Bay is a Must Do cafe, great food and great vibe - it's worth the wait in the queue.

						<td class="itinerary-cell2"><a class="link" href="http://www.sanbi.org/gardens/kirstenbosch" target="_blank">Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens</a> offers some beautiful gardens with the dramatic backdrop of Devils Peak behind. They have just built a new Tree Top Canopy that has added an extra visiting appeal. It's not at the very top of things to do i.e. if it's a choice of this vs say wine tasting, then wine tasting trumps, but if you've got a few hours free then definitely go have a look. The <a class="link" href="https://www.citysightseeing.co.za/cape-town/tours" target="_blank">Red Bus Tour</a> stops here so that gives a nice way to get to see the gardens. <b>Kirstenbosch Summer Concerts</b> are awesome and definitely worth going if there is one scheduled during your stay. They don't have the schedule for 2017 up yet so I can't check (usually the last one is around beginning April), but they're on Sundays and you'll need to book ahead. The website has all the details.</td>

						<td class="itinerary-cell2">If you're a water sporty person then you might like to have a go at some surfing! Muizenberg is the spot for this and there are a couple of surf schools right there on the beach, one of which is <a class="link" href="http://www.garysurf.com/" target="_blank">Gary's Surf School</a>. The surf can be quite fickle so it's worth phoning first to check if there is decent surf before driving all the way there, unless you're passing that way anyway.

I feel a bit in two minds about something like this - on the one hand it seems wrong to gwark at people in poverty, but on the other hand it's a valuable experience to remind us of how fortunate we are and to see another side of life and living and hardship. I have never done one of these tours but have been in the townships doing charity work and it is a memorable experience. Because I've never done a tour I wouldn't know which to recommend or not so you'll need to investigate this yourself.</td>

The walk is not as staunch as TM either - walking up TM takes about 2-3 hours, depending on your level of fitness, whereas Lions Head is about 45mins-1 hour. However note that the top part of the walk requires some <b>very easy</b> scrambling, so might not be suitable for all. A popular thing is to do sundowners on Lions Head, since it doesn't take too long to get to the top and the walk is easy and can be done in the dark with a headlamp (when coming back down). Make sure you take a headlamp, warm clothes, plenty water, and maybe a blankie too :)</td>
