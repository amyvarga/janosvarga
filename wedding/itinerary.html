It may be that some will need to be swapped around due to weather or such like, but this at least gives you an idea of what we're thinking in terms of when we'll be where and for how long, and what other activities we thought to put in during our stay in SA. Some days the stated activity may only take half the day, leaving you free to do other things or just chill on the beach. See the <a class="link" href="mustdos.html">Must Dos</a> page for other things to do while in SA and Cape Town.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">The point of this itinerary is so that we can do things together as a group. So unless otherwise specified, you're welcome to join in for all or one or some of the activities. No expectations either way - just come along if you keen. My plan is to create a Whatsapp & Facebook group closer to the time, and we'll use those to keep everyone informed of what is happening on a particular day, where to meet & when, what to bring etc. For the activities that require driving I reckon we car pool.</td></tr>
			
			<tr><td class="detail-cell">Since it's still early days we may change or move the activities detailed before the 9th April and after the 17th depending on when family and friends are coming out, since we obviously want to optimise time with everyone. Because of this it would be great if you can give us an indication of when you're thinking of coming and for how long, and what you'd be keen to do. Hopefully this itinerary will not need to be changed. <b>The core time in CT from the 9th to the 17th is set</b>, but exactly which activities happen on what day may change. Just note this is a first draft and not set in stone yet, so perhaps check in with us before making a booking - obviously go ahead and book if you're keen to do it by yourselves or irrespective of what we are doing. Wedding date is of course set and you should book for CT and Paternoster without delay.

You can picnic on the grass or have lunch at the cafe. <b>Kirstenbosch Summer Concerts</b> are awesome and definitely worth going if there is one scheduled during your stay. They don't have the schedule for 2017 up yet so I can't check (usually the last one is around beginning April), but they're on Sundays and you'll need to book ahead. The website has all the details.

						<td class="itinerary-cell2"><span class="main">Stellenbosch: Wine tasting</span><br>There are heaps of wine estates that you can visit and do tastings at. Generally you have to pay for a tasting - it used to be free but the students abused this so they started charging. However the price is very reasonable and ranges from as little as R15 to R50, depending on the vineyard. This price usually includes 4 or 5 wines to taste. Many estates offer tasting combos - wine & biltong or wine & cheese for example. And some have restaurants too. This <a class="link" href ="http://www.capetownmagazine.com/top-wine-tastings" target="_blank">website</a> has a good review with details of what tastings are offered and prices. We really love <a class="link" href="http://www.waterfordestate.co.za/" target="_blank">Waterford</a> where you can do a wine & chocolate tasting which is quite special. We'll decide closer to the time which ones we visit, but some other really nice ones are <a class="link" href="http://detrafford.co.za/" target="_blank">De Trafford</a>, <a class="link" href="http://www.delaire.co.za/" target="_blank">Delaire Graff</a> and <a class="link" href="http://www.bartinney.co.za/wines/" target="_blank">Bartinney</a>. We'll possibly have lunch in Stellenbosch somewhere, since it's definitely worth taking a drive through the town as it's really beautiful. <a class="link" href="http://www.hillcrestberries.co.za/" target="_blank">Hillcrest Berry Farm</a> is also a nice spot to have breakfast or lunch.

We will go for the <b>11am ferry</b>. I really enjoyed the trip to Robben Island and I would recommend it, so if you're leaving on the weekend then try make a time to do this. A nice way to end the day is to walk up Lions Head (approx 45 mins up) and have sundowners (drinks and snacks while watching the sun go down). Remember that its sunDOWNERS which means it's dark, or near dark, by the time we're walking back down so bring headlamps and warm clothes. Blankies are nice too for while watching the sun go down. The very last bit to the top requires some <b>very easy</b> scrambling so will not be suitable for everyone. There is a spot you can stop before this and watch the sunset from there. What will probably work best is if we split into an upper & lower group :)
